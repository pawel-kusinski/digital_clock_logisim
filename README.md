# Digital Clock in Logisim evolution

A digital clock built in Logisim-evolution.

## How to use:
Once the simulation is initiated, press the `RESET` button to begin.

The clock operates in two modes:

1. Normal clock operation:
    * In this mode, the LEDs located between the 7-segment displays will toggle with every clock cycle.
    * Pressing the `SET_HOUR` and `SET_MIN` buttons in this mode will have no effect.
2. Time setting:
    * Upon entering this mode, the seconds counter resets.
    * You can adjust the hours by pressing the `SET_HOUR` button.
    * Similarly, you can set the minutes using the `SET_MIN` button.

To switch between these modes, press the `RUN_SET` button.
